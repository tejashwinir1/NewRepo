Please follow the instructions carefully.

N.B :
 - BEFORE UPDATING TO THE LATEST VERSION, WE WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU KEEP A BACKUP OF THE EXISTING VERSION.

 - Before updating to version 1.1, make sure that you currently running your product on version 1.0.

Let's proceed,
- Replace the Updater.php file manually with existing Updater.php file on your server.
	-File location: Root directory > application > controllers > Updater.php
- Go to system settings from settings menu in admin panel
- Move to the section 'Update Product' on that page
- Upload the file 'update_1.1.zip' which is located at update_pack > v1.1 folder inside your copy of Mastery-LMS downloaded from Codecanyon.
- Hit the button 'Update product version'.
- That's it.
